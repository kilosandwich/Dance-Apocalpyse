Dance Apocalpyse - Created by Phillip Wandyez for Spartahack 2024
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=
I used to be more into Quest modding, which involved extended storylines
and compelling characters. However with Computer Science that has fallen by
the waywide. I created a lot of spare levels that I just have floating around
including a theater for a never completed musical project, a complete recreation
of Scaramanga's lair from the Man With The Golden Gun, a church with an iconolastic 
pumpkin, and a lair with a comically tall robot granted invulnerability to all
but melee attacks.

One of the planned battle arenas was reused for this - and was instead fitted 
as a theater with steps used as triggerboxes to play Dance Dance Revolution

This was extremely difficult to program - the creation kit has very little documentation
and has no real way to store information. This is in part because the creation kit has
been continually bootstrapped since 2003, and still very clearly resembles the tools
used to make Morrowind and Oblivion - but now poorly retrofitted for firearms.

However, I can say proudly that it does work
Simply
1.) Coc to 17Mass Avenue
2.) Go to the large theater room
3.) Hit the button

Enjoy the dance!
